    "<!-- Weighted Correlation Aggregation for establishing regions of overlap across static multi camera systems -->\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective Recap:\n",
    "* Given footage from multiple views throughout a scene, identify individuals traveling through the scene and maintain that identity across all available perspectives in which they appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions:\n",
    "* The footage is from static cameras.\n",
    "* The real world overlap, positionings and calibrations of the cameras are not provided.\n",
    "* The footage is synchronized such that frame n from any camera will represent roughly the same real world time as frame n from any other camera.\n",
    "* Ground Truth multi camera track-lets are extremely limited and may not be available at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Problem to Solve:\n",
    "### Where did I come from?\n",
    "As an instance-level recognition problem, person re-ID faces two major challenges. First, the intra-class (instance/identity) variations are typically big due to the changes of camera viewing conditions. For instance, the view change across cameras (front to back) brings large appearance changes, making matching the same person difficult. Second, there are also small inter-class variations – people in public space often wear similar clothing; from a distance as typically in surveillance videos,they can look incredibly similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this it would be useful if we could leverage the fact that we're observing a realtime surveillance system inorder to place additional constraints on which identities can be linked. And our assumptions provide several...\n",
    "\n",
    "* Identities observed at the same time in the same camera cannot be the same person.\n",
    "* Under most circumstances the likelihood that two seperate images contain the same person is inversely proportional to the amount of time that has passed since the most recent image was captured.\n",
    "* Security cameras are often placed along passageways and common areas in such a way that the particular sequence of cameras that an individual might pass through is predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the first two are fairly simple to apply the last one requires that we either have some information on the real world placement or relationships of each camera which according to our assumptions we don't. And without enough multi camera tracks to train from we can't just observe which cameras people tend to reappear in. So in-order to get around this we need some unsupervised method to quantify which camera B, identities from camera A are likely to appear in simultaneously or after an allowed gap time. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Current Solutions in Code:\n",
    "So what I choose to do is leverage the fact that the footage is synchronized, and the relationship between motion of objects in overlapping cameras will usually remain consistent if they stay in the same position and are observing the same real world object. So by looking at the correlated motion over time, we can build some idea of how likely an object in camera A is related to an object in camera B. Then in order to better apply these associations to new detections we break the image into patches so that if only certain areas of the image overlap we don't build unwarranted correlations. "
